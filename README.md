# strava-personal-heatmap
Visualize all the grounds you have covered based on the activities recorded in [strava](https://www.strava.com)

I built it mainly for my personal use and do not plan to publish it in a publicly usable manner. You can [get your own](https://developers.strava.com/docs/getting-started/#b-how-to-create-an-account) strava client id and client secret, a google maps API key and put them [here](https://strava-heatmap.sakib.dev/) to get it working.

Note: the strava API has a rate limit of 100 requests per 15 minutes. If you have more than 100 activites, you may have to try several times in 15 minute intervals to get the full heatmap
